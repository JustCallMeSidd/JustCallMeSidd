## About me
I enjoy turning research and prototypes into usable apps. My recent work focuses on medical imaging, GANs for creative image synthesis, and retrieval-augmented generation for domain-specific chatbots. I prefer Python-based stacks and deploying lightweight web UIs with Streamlit.

## Selected Projects

### Tumor X
Tools: Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV  
Feb 2025 â€“ Mar 2025 Â· [Project Link](https://github.com/JustCallMeSidd/tumor-x)  
- Assembled a dual-model pipeline (EfficientNetB3 + U-Net) achieving 95% classification accuracy on 7k+ MRIs.  
- Implemented reliable tumor segmentation and a Streamlit app that generates clinical PDF reports â€” reduced manual reporting time by ~40%.

### Canvas AI
Tools: Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow, NumPy, PIL  
Sep 2024 â€“ Oct 2024 Â· [Project Link](https://github.com/JustCallMeSidd/canvas-ai)  
- Built two GAN-based models: one for converting hand-drawn sketches into realistic color images (PokÃ©mon) and another for artistic-style transfers (cubism, impressionism).  
- Deployed a real-time Streamlit app handling 1k+ user uploads with <2s average transformation latency.

### Ayurvedic Chatbot with RAG
Tools: Python, Streamlit, LangChain, Gemini API  
Jan 2025 â€“ Feb 2025 Â· [Project Link](https://github.com/JustCallMeSidd/ayurvedic-chatbot)  
- Built a semantic-search chatbot over Ayurvedic remedies with ~90% retrieval accuracy.  
- Launched a Streamlit interface â€” improved query-to-response performance by ~30% over baselines (tested on 500+ queries).

### Cardio-Care
Tools: Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV  
Aug 2025 â€“ Sep 2025 Â· [Project Link](https://github.com/JustCallMeSidd/cardio-care)  
- Developed a CNN-based classifier for ECG images to detect six cardiac conditions (incl. MI, LBBB, RBBB) with ~92% validation accuracy.  
- Streamlit app enabled rapid screening of 1k+ ECGs and reduced diagnostic turnaround by ~35%.
